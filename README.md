# cookie-mania
A cookie-clicker designed to make you furious

## what is this?
Its a cookie-clicker game I programmed during our Lab-Sessions at HF IAD17 at the SfGZ in Zurich just using HTML, CSS and Javascript. There is no real reason to play this game if you dont have any masochistic tendencies. There is not even a reward at the end!

This project was done to play around with Javascript and I liked to play around with the randomness.
